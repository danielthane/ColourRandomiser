# Colour Randomizer JS Project

I got the idea from the sample projects on freeCodeCamp and decided to give it a go completely on my own! Really happy with the finished product and impressed with the ammount of JS stuff i remembered from my recent studies.

## Main Issues

- The CSS for the "Background Color" box, I can't get the box to be always exactly the right size and grow/shrink with the length of the content. I know this is something to do with a heading being a block elelement but couldn't work out how to get it just the way I wanted. As I say I think it looks ok, but when using the simple selector there is a line break when the RGBA colour appaears.
- I feel like the code used when selecting the mode in the header buttons is messy and very repeated for the "Simple" and "Hex" but I wasn't sure how best to refactor this.

## What I learnt

- Consolidated my JS knowledge, mainly selecting elements, changing innerHTML etc.
- Arrow funstions can be used when adding an event listener as well as the annonymous functions I've been using on the Udemy course I'm following.

Above all though, it works!!!
